# Project 1 - Crawl picture 
Those files will help you download a picture form website <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com> or <https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/>

A file will use some tricks because the `src` of the `<img>` is also the website's URL. So that in this file, I won't use [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files.

The other will use [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. But it can't select the age, race, gender. It will be random.
