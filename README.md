# Project 1 - Crawl picture 
Those files will help you download a picture form website <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com> or <https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/>

The `crawlpicture.py` will use some tricks because the `src` of the `<img>` is also the website's URL. So that in this file, I won't use [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files.

The `crawlpicture1.1.py` will use [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. But it can't select the age, race, gender. It will be random.

The `crawlpicture1.2.py` will use [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) to perform many automated tasks on the web browser. This file can customize the parameters you desire.

# Instructions 

In all 3 folders, you just need to run the program.

The folder that the program will use to save the image will be created right in the folder on the path of the terminal window in VSCode

For example the downloaded image with the name test.jpg will be saved to the download_image1, which will be created in the Crawl_picture_project_1
